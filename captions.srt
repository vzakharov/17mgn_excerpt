1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,080
My face has some really strange characteristics. 
Everyone thinks they've just seen me somewhere.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,800
You're stereotypical.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
Similar to many others.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
For good or bad?

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
For spies, it's probably quite 
good, but for a diplomat,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,840
that's apparently not good. You 
need to have memorable faces.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,040
And for soldiers?

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,240
For our military forces, for 
our military personnel, it

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,000
is now absolutely essential to have strong legs.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,080
And how about his head, then?

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,120
What do our heads have to do with 
it? They do the thinking for us.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,880
We just carry out orders. Legs are 
important. Legs to get away in time.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,680
Aren't you afraid to talk like that to a stranger?

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
So what, you don't know what my name is.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
It is very easy to identify. Because 
you have a very memorable face.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Is that so? Oh, damn it. I honestly always 
believed my face was just the most common,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,080
the most average one. But even so, it 
doesn't really matter. Until you report me,

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
until a second witness is found. Time 
will pass and it will be over. We'll be

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,600
put in the dock by them, not the us. And 
first and foremost, you the diplomats.

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:36,560
You were killing. You were destroying. 
You were burning. And they will judge us?

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,120
We were carrying out orders. The SS 
were the ones burning. We were fighting.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,840
Did they invent a new way to fight 
without destruction or loss of life?

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,800
War is one way or another a necessity; not such 
a foolish one, of course, this is a diletant's

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,640
war. He decided that one could wage war, not by 
training at an academy, but purely by intuition.

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,320
He decided that he alone truly knows what all 
of us need. He decided that he alone loves great

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Germany, and all we do is think about how to 
sell it to the filthy Bolshevik Cossack kikes.

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,880
What's that?

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Cossack kikes, that's something 
new. I haven't heard that before.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,680
Oh, you can expect anything from the 
Reds, but also from the Americans. I've

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,880
been fighting them for a year. These 
fools will be destroyed by their very

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:03:03,920
own technology. They think that a war 
can be won by bombing alone. *Prost!*

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,000
They will build up their technical might and be 
overwhelmed by it. It will corrode them like rush.

33
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,160
They will decide that they can 
do whatever they please. The reds

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,360
think this way because they are wild, 
impoverished people. Americans think

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,400
this way because they are simply too rich. 
Therefore, wars are absolutely necessary.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
No connection.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
What?

38
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm telling you, there's no connection. 
Something in your argument is falling apart.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:41,840
Nothing is falling apart. Nations are just like 
people. They simply cannot stand stagnation. The

40
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,280
borders are suffocating them. They need 
movement. That's an axiom. Movement is

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,880
war. But if you damn diplomats mess up again, 
then they will destroy every last one of you.

42
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,160
We were simply following orders. We are soldiers 
just like you are, soldiers of the Fuehrer.

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, stop pretending, will you? 
You're the Fuehrer's soldiers.

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
A lowranking man who stole a general's boots.

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,120
I'm afraid to speak with you, General.

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,160
Don't lie. All of Germany is speaking just 
like me. Or at least they're thinking it.

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,200
And and uh what about those boys from the Hitler 
youth when they are sent against the Russian

48
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,160
tanks? Do they also think there are are they 
dying with the words Heil Hitler on their lips?

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Fanaticism will never achieve a final 
victory. People grow weary of fanaticism.

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,120
And then this very same fanaticism dissolves 
into the thoughts and patterns of behavior

51
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
of the defeated. Fanatics might win 
in the early stages, but they will

52
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,120
never truly hold on to victory because they 
will eventually tire of themselves. *Prost!*

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160
Just then why on earth aren't 
you moving your division?

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
A corps.

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,720
All the more reason why won't 
you surrender with your corps.

56
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,680
And the family? And what about the the 
fanatics at headquarters and the cowards

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
who'd rather fight believing in a mythical 
victory than be turned in an allied camp.

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
But you can order.

59
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,320
An order is to die. There are no orders 
yet to live by surrendering to the enemy.

60
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
No army in the world has 
learned to write such commands.

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
What if you get such an order?

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:38,880
From whom? From this neurotic? He's dragging every 
single one of us down to the grave. It's truly

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,480
terrifying to die when you're all alone. But in 
a group, it's nothing. You can even make a joke.

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,360
What if Keitel gives you that order?

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,160
He's got an ass for a head. He's 
a secretary, not a military man.

66
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,920
Well, all right then. Your 
commander-in-chief is in Italy.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
Kesselring? He would never 
agree to something like that.

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,800
Why is that?

69
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,080
He was brought up within Goering's headquarters. 
But anyone who works under the command of such a

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,360
leader is bound to lose their initiative. 
They acquire a certain dexterity. They

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,560
become a skilled analyst. But they lose the 
crucial ability to make their own independent

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,880
decisions. He before making a decision on such 
a step will absolutely have to fly to the Boar.

73
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,480
To whom? Towards the Boar. Towards Goering.

74
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Are you convinced Kesselring can't be persuaded 
to take this step without Goering's approval?

75
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,080
If I weren't convinced, I wouldn't say.

76
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,880
So you don't see a future?

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,320
I believe in the future

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,160
in the prospect of an impending doom. All of us,

79
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:18,880
the whole entire group. It's not frightening, 
believe me, when we are all united together...

80
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,920
and our destruction would be so utterly 
devastating that the memory of it will

81
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:34,000
deeply wound the hearts of many more 
generations of unfortunate Germans.

82
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,320
I have made my final will and 
testament for my children. May

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,360
every single form of democracy 
be utterly cursed throughout

84
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:55,440
our entire Reich. Any democracy in our 
country is fraught with only one thing.

85
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,320
Dictatorship of petty traders.

86
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,880
The more freedoms we have, the 
sooner we crave stability,..

87
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,640
secret police, concentration camps,

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:19,280
and widespread universal fear. Only 
then do we truly feel at peace.

89
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,400
(Then) you don't need to defend your own 
points of view few regarding the fate of the

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,240
motherland. Absolutely no responsibility. Just 
just raise your hand in honor of the one who's

91
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,120
doing it for you. Just shout Heil Hitler 
and everything will be perfectly clear.

92
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
No agitation.
